# TrackConnect-SwiftUI
An Universial app built with Swift UI to calculate the potential placement a mark would place on any given year. Works on MacOS and iOS

Â°Currently this applicaton only works for Division 1 Western Region for Men. The app is a proof of concept and with more time could be a fully fleshed out database. 
*Times are taken as strings to compare so 08:38.3 vs. 8.34.3 will say the first string is the faster time because of the leading 0.
